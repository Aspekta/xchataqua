What is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~
 X-Chat is an IRC client for UNIX operating systems. I.R.C. is Internet
 Relay Chat, see http://irchelp.org for more information about IRC in
 general. Xchat runs on most BSD and POSIX compliant operating systems.

 X-Chat Aqua is a Mac OS X-specific version of X-Chat which utilizes the
 Cocoa API and is written in Objective-C.


Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 X-Chat Aqua is designed to run on Mac OS X 10.4 and above.


Python Scripts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Scripts for X-Chat 1.8.x are not compatible, and a brand new interface
 has been written.

 Documentation can be found here: http://xchat.org/docs/.

 Consider using the Python interface for your scripts, it's a very nice
 API, allows for loading/unloading individual scripts, and gives you
 almost all the features of the C-Plugin API.


Perl Scripts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Scripts for 1.8.x are compatible with the following exceptions:

* IRC::command will not interpret %C, %B, %U etc.

* user_list and user_list_short:
  If a user has both op and voice, only the op flag will be 1.

* add_user_list/sub_user_list/clear_user_list
  These functions do nothing.

* notify_list
  Not implemented. Always returns an empty list.

* server_list
  Lists servers that are not connected aswell.

* Some print events may have new names and some were added.

* Text printed by scripts must now be UTF8.

* Text passed to scripts (via add_message_handler) will be encoded in UTF8.


Autoloading Perl Scripts and Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * X-Chat automatically loads, at startup:
	~/.xchat2/*.pl Perl scripts
	~/.xchat2/*.py Python scripts
	~/.xchat2/*.so Plugins
	$(libdir)/xchat/plugins/*.so plugins
	(this usually translates to /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/*.so)


Control Codes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 %%     -  A single percentage sign
 %C     -  Control-C (mIRC color code)
 %B     -  Bold Text
 %U     -  Underline Text
 %R     -  Reverse Text
 %O     -  Reset all Text attributes
 %XXX   -  ASCII XXX (where XXX is a decimal 3 digit number)
           (Eg: %007 sends a BEEP)

 %Cforeground,background will produce a color code, eg: %C03,10

 These are now disabled by default (see Settings > Prefs > Input Box).
 Instead you can insert the real codes via ctrl-k, ctrl-b and ctrl-o.
